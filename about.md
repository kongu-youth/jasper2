## Overview
Kongu Youth of America is an organization that works to promote the cultural, educational, and social enrichment of Kongu youth in the United States. Its goal is to unify Kongu youth, educate, and carry on our traditions and history for generations to come.
## Where We Got Started
The idea for KYA was born at the general 2018 National Kongu Meet in Washington, D.C. during a discussion over dinner among all the attendees. Together we were able to have discussions on oru culture, while also relating professionaly and personally. And that's when we wanted something larger to bring other people like us together. After collecting contact information from those attendees we were able to build up a network and eventually create the community we have today.
## Who We Are
KYA is a youth-run organization that aims to promote Kongu culture in the US for young adults ages 14-30. Local meetups include anyone 14+ and the national convention includes anyone 18-30.
## What We Do
We organize meetings for Kongu youth at the local and national level, providing a space for Kongu youth to express ourselves and bond over our common lived experience.
