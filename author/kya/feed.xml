&lt;p&gt;At the beginning of the summer of 2021, we hosted a 21+ event to garner interest among the older members of KYA. During this event we played trivia and made cocktails.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

&lt;p&gt;Hello all,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This post will detail how the current coronavirus situation affects the national meets. Currently, we have the Dallas national meet scheduled for Labor Day weekend of 2021. At this point, the coronavirus vaccine is starting to roll out, and we expect by the summertime that at least 60-70% of Americans will have received both doses of the vaccine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, different areas have different vaccine percentages, with states in the South generally in the lower side, and states in the North on the higher side. With that said, we anticipate that anyone coming to the convention will be fully vaccinated.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, to be extra careful, we have postponed the event to &lt;strong&gt;MLK Weekend of 2022. We do not anticipate this date to change further.&lt;/strong&gt; Thank you for your understanding. Please follow our website for event plans once we get closer to the event date.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thank you!&lt;/p&gt;</content>

&lt;p&gt;On Saturday, we … (include pictures on the side)\&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;sunday-events&quot;&gt;Sunday Events&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On Sunday, we took our events outdoors to a field just outside DC. There we had plenty of outdoor activities, such as hiking, frisbee, and more! (include more pictures)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;till-next-time&quot;&gt;Till Next Time?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That concludes our first national meet. Please look forward to our next national meet, with a current target time of very early 2021! Stay tuned to our blog and website for updates.&lt;/p&gt;</content>
