&lt;p&gt;Hello everyone,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As you probably are all aware, there is a pandemic that is wreaking havoc across the world. This has led to many measures such as mandatory masks, social distancing, no gatherings of large people.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In light of this situation, we have decided to &lt;strong&gt;postpone&lt;/strong&gt; the national meet scheduled for January 2021 to &lt;strong&gt;Labor Day weekend of 2021&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Keep in mind that this is a tentative date and is subject to change.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Please monitor our website for updates in case this date changes further.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Mughil Pari</name></author><category term="events" /><summary type="html">An update on how the COVID-19 outbreak is affecting our national meets…</summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Happy Hour</title><link href="/happy-hour" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Happy Hour" /><published>2021-05-20T00:00:00+00:00</published><updated>2021-05-20T00:00:00+00:00</updated><id>/happy-hour</id><content type="html" xml:base="/happy-hour">&lt;p&gt;A chance for adults of KYA to get together.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hello all,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This post will detail how the current coronavirus situation affects the national meets. Currently, we have the Dallas national meet scheduled for Labor Day weekend of 2021. At this point, the coronavirus vaccine is starting to roll out, and we expect by the summertime that at least 60-70% of Americans will have received both doses of the vaccine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, different areas have different vaccine percentages, with states in the South generally in the lower side, and states in the North on the higher side. With that said, we anticipate that anyone coming to the convention will be fully vaccinated.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, to be extra careful, we have postponed the event to &lt;strong&gt;MLK Weekend of 2022. We do not anticipate this date to change further.&lt;/strong&gt; Thank you for your understanding. Please follow our website for event plans once we get closer to the event date.&lt;/p&gt;
